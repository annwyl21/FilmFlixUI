# FilmFlixUI

[Flask App available on render](https://filmflixui.onrender.com/) which connects to my [RestAPI](https://filmflixrestapi.onrender.com) also deployed on render

This is the simple flask app I built to access my python microservice, a RestAPI to perform CRUD operations on an SQLite database.
